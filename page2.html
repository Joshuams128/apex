                    <p class="maintext">For almost 300 years, Revenant was under the Syndicate’s thumb with the help of Hammond, and all he wanted was to escape. Now, suddenly, he starts to glitch—someone has launched a new protocol. He finds that he’s able to see enemies low on health, unleash a powerful leap forward, and forge a shroud of shadows around him that blocks incoming damage. But he also knows how to hold a grudge. 

                        Check out Revenant’s new look and new abilities for yourself! He’s unlocked all season long, and you can complete challenges throughout the season to unlock him permanently. Read the full breakdown of Revenant’s rework and get behind the screens

They were joined by August Brinkman, Sok Leng’s eventual husband. But when August’s selfish playstyle led to Kit Siang’s death, August would retreat from the Games, from Sok Leng, and from their young son, Nate.

                        August spent decades as a recluse. When Nate decides to follow his family’s legacy into the arena, August returns to strike a deal to reenter the Games in his son’s place.</p>

                        LEGENDS!
World Wide Launch is upon us and we could not be more excited to share Apex Legends Mobile with the world. So strap in for a brand new adventure as we introduce a new Legend to the Apex Games: Fade.

NEW LEGEND:
Fade.
Ignacio Huamaní was the youngest in a family of military-tech hunters. Working together, they made a living “recovering” weaponry and selling it to the highest bidder.

                    <p class="maintext2">NEW LEGEND: NEWCASTLE
                        HEROIC DEFENDER
                        For years, Newcastle defended the small town of Harris Valley, making it a safe haven for all who lived there. Now to fulfill that mission and continue defending his home, he’ll have to prove himself a hero among Legends. In the Apex Games, Newcastle can use his Knockdown Shield to protect his squadmate as he revives them, and even drag them out of harm’s way. He can charge into the fray with a Mobile Shield, blocking weapon damage and deflecting grenades, while his Ultimate erects a fortified Castle Wall. </p>
